Project Description
    - Problem statement
        * While there a lot of reading list apps that let you save what books you'd like to read, none of them offer you the option of taking a picture of the title or author of a book and returning a list of other books by that author!
    
    - How will your project solve this problem?
        * By using the Google Vision API and the GoodReads API, my reading list will be able to send a picture for text recognition, then pull data from a massive library of authors and books to recommend new titles, show information about the author, and let you save the books you want to read.
    
    - Map the user experience
        * Users will open the app on their IOS device and be able to review the books they've already saved or have the option to take a picture of a new book of which they want to find information. After they've taken a picture of the title or author, the app will do a search for the book the user is holding, other books the author has written, and suggested titles based on the genre or author. The user will then have the option to save these titles to their reading list!

    - What technologies do you plan to use?
        * Swift, Realm Mobile Database, Google Vision API (text recognition), GoodReads API (author, title information, other suggested books)
